        Reading is a very good habit that one needs to develop in life. Good
        books can inform you, enlighten you and lead you in the right direction.
        There is no better companion than a good book. Reading is important
        because it is good for your overall well-being. Once you start reading,
        you experience a whole new world. When you start loving the habit of
        reading you eventually get addicted to it. Reading develops language
        skills and vocabulary. Reading books is also a way to relax and reduce
        stress. It is important to read a good book at least for a few minutes
        each day to stretch the brain muscles for healthy functioning.
